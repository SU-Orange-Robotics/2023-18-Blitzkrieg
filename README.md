## Folders:
- OrangeBot_23: Main library
- Others: practice projects for testing/learning purposes

## Collaboration Guidelines

### Branching
- use "firstname/branch-feature" format for branch names.
- always create new branches when working on a new feature, even for the smallest features.

### Commits
- write a short description for the commits e.g. "added basic PID control for the fly wheel"

### Naming Convention
- for class files, use underscore such as "mecanum_drive.hpp"
- use lower camel case for variables, and upper cammel case for funcitons. (e.g. "int turnRate; void TurnRight(){}")

### Creating Project
- name project folders clearly what it does.
